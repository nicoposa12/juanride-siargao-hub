  - Rental duration: 5 days
  - Subtotal: ₱2,500
  - Platform fee: ₱250 (JuanRide keeps this)

## Success Metrics (KPIs)

**Key Performance Indicators to Track:**

### 1. Supply-Side Metrics (Owners)

**A. Active Vehicles Listed:**
- **Target:** 300 vehicles by Month 12
- **Tracking:** Count of vehicles with `status = 'available'` AND `is_approved = true`

**B. Owner Retention Rate:**
- **Formula:** (Owners still active after 6 months / Total owners who joined) × 100
- **Target:** 70% retention
- **Why it matters:** High churn means we're not providing value

**C. Average Earnings Per Owner:**
- **Formula:** Total owner earnings / Number of owners
- **Target:** ₱8,000/month per owner
- **Tracking:** Dashboard showing owner monthly earnings

**D. Listing Approval Time:**
- **Formula:** Time from submission to admin approval
- **Target:** < 24 hours
- **Why it matters:** Slow approval frustrates owners

---

### 2. Demand-Side Metrics (Renters)

**A. Total Bookings:**
- **Target:** 1,200 bookings in Month 12
- **Tracking:** Count of `bookings` with `status = 'completed'`

**B. Booking Conversion Rate:**
- **Formula:** (Bookings completed / Vehicle page visits) × 100
- **Target:** 5%
- **Example:** 1,000 people view vehicle pages → 50 complete bookings

**C. Average Booking Value (ABV):**
- **Formula:** Total booking revenue / Number of bookings
- **Target:** ₱3,200
- **Tracking:** Average of `bookings.total_price`

**D. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
- **Formula:** Total marketing spend / Number of new renters
- **Target:** < ₱300 per renter
- **Example:** Spend ₱30,000 on ads, acquire 120 renters → CAC = ₱250 ✅

---

### 3. Platform Health Metrics

**A. Search-to-Booking Time:**
- **Formula:** Average time from first vehicle search to booking confirmation
- **Target:** < 15 minutes
- **Why it matters:** Faster booking = better UX

**B. Payment Success Rate:**
- **Formula:** (Successful payments / Total payment attempts) × 100
- **Target:** > 95%
- **Why it matters:** Failed payments = lost revenue

**C. Dispute Rate:**
- **Formula:** (Bookings with disputes / Total bookings) × 100
- **Target:** < 2%
- **Example:** 5 disputes out of 500 bookings = 1% ✅

**D. Platform Uptime:**
- **Target:** 99.9% uptime (< 1 hour downtime per month)
- **Monitoring:** Use Vercel analytics

---

### 4. Financial Metrics

**A. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):**
- **Formula:** Sum of all platform fees earned in a month
- **Target:** ₱384,000 by Month 12

**B. Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV):**
- **Formula:** Total value of all bookings (before fees)
- **Target:** ₱3,840,000 by Month 12

**C. Unit Economics:**
- **Formula:** (Average revenue per booking - CAC) / Average revenue per booking
- **Target:** > 50% margin
- **Example:** Avg booking earns us ₱300, CAC is ₱100 → ₱200 profit (67% margin) ✅

## Competitive Advantage

### What Makes JuanRide Different?

**1. Local Focus vs. Big Platforms**
- **Airbnb:** Great for homestays, but poor vehicle rental experience

- **Our Advantage:** Built specifically for Siargao's unique needs
  - Philippine payment methods (GCash, Maya)
  - Tagalog/Bisaya support
  - Local pricing expectations

**2. Owner-Friendly Economics**
- **Traditional Rental Shops:** Take 30-40% commission

- **Impact:** Owner earning ₱10,000/month keeps ₱9,000 with us vs. ₱6,000 with shops

**3. Technology Advantage**
- **Competitors:** Manual booking via text/calls, cash payments
- **JuanRide:**
  - Real-time availability calendar
  - Instant payment via PayMongo
  - Live chat for quick communication
  - Automated confirmations and reminders

**4. Trust & Safety**
- **Verification System:** Government ID upload for all users
- **Review System:** Both renters and owners rate each other
- **Secure Payments:** PayMongo escrow (money held until booking starts)
- **Insurance Options:** (Future feature) Damage protection plans

**5. Data-Driven Pricing**
- **Future Feature:** Dynamic pricing recommendations
- **Example:** "Your motorcycle is priced ₱500/day, but similar vehicles nearby rent for ₱550. Consider increasing price by ₱50."
- Helps owners maximize earnings
