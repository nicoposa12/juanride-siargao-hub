# JuanRide: Digital Vehicle Rental System for Efficient Booking and Monitoring

## Project Overview

### Vision Statement

JuanRide aims to revolutionize the vehicle rental market in Siargao Island by creating a centralized, efficient, and user-friendly digital marketplace. Our vision is to become the leading platform for vehicle rentals in tourist destinations across the Philippines, starting with Siargao, where we will bridge the gap between traditional, manual rental processes and modern digital convenience.

### Problem Statement

Siargao Island, a major tourist destination in the Philippines, faces significant challenges in its vehicle rental ecosystem. The current market relies heavily on outdated, manual processes that create friction for both vehicle owners and renters:

**For Vehicle Owners:**
- Inefficient fleet management using paper records and spreadsheets
- Frequent double bookings due to lack of real-time availability tracking
- Difficulty tracking vehicle locations and status
- Inaccurate revenue tracking and financial reporting
- Limited customer reach beyond word-of-mouth and social media
- Time-consuming manual coordination via phone calls and messages
- No systematic approach to maintenance scheduling
- Risk of vehicle theft or misuse

**For Renters (Tourists & Locals):**
- Fragmented and frustrating booking experience
- No centralized platform to view and compare rental options
- Uncertainty about vehicle availability and pricing
- Hidden fees and unclear rental terms
- Unreliable communication through Facebook Messenger
- Long wait times for booking confirmations
