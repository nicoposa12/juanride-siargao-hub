# CHAPTER V: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

## 5.1 Summary

The JuanRide Vehicle Rental Platform represents a comprehensive digital solution designed to address the inefficiencies and limitations inherent in traditional vehicle rental operations in Siargao. This capstone project successfully developed and implemented a full-stack web application utilizing modern technologies including Next.js 14 with React, Supabase for backend services, PostgreSQL for database management, and PayMongo for payment processing integration.

The platform architecture is built on a three-tier model comprising the presentation layer (React-based user interface), application layer (Next.js API routes and business logic), and data layer (Supabase with PostgreSQL database). This architectural design ensures separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. The system implements five core functional flows: (1) Authentication and Role-Based Routing, (2) Vehicle Booking Creation and Checkout Process, (3) Owner Fleet Management and Vehicle Listing, (4) Administrative Vehicle Approval and Platform Oversight, and (5) Multi-Method Payment Processing through PayMongo integration.

The development process followed an Agile methodology with iterative sprints, allowing for continuous testing, feedback incorporation, and refinement. Key features implemented include comprehensive user authentication with Supabase Auth, role-based access control (RBAC) enforced through middleware, real-time vehicle availability checking with conflict prevention, integrated payment processing supporting multiple methods (credit/debit cards, GCash, Maya, and QR PH), owner dashboard for fleet management, and administrative oversight tools for platform governance.

Security measures were implemented at multiple levels, including Row-Level Security (RLS) policies in the database, JWT-based session management, middleware-enforced route protection, input validation and sanitization, and secure API endpoint authentication. Automated database triggers handle critical operations such as user profile creation upon registration, booking conflict validation, automatic status updates, platform fee calculations, and email notification dispatching.

The system underwent rigorous testing including unit testing of individual components, integration testing across modules, user acceptance testing with stakeholders, and security vulnerability assessments. Test results confirmed that all core functionalities operate as designed, delivering a seamless experience from user registration through vehicle discovery, booking creation, payment processing, and post-booking communication.
